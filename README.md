Substance
=========

Substance is a Content Management System (CMS) and application framework.
Substance is intended to be a standards based, object oriented application
framework that happens to include a Web based CMS, both as example of what the
framework can do and as a driver for the development of the framework.

The framework is based on carefully chosen standards (which ideally *would
not* include PHP as a base!).
